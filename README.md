# Face_Emotion_Recognition_Machine_Learning
Hello Everyone !! This is a project using the OpenCV library in Machine Learning for Face Emotion Detection.
It also works on live detection and is highly accurate.

To run code-
1. Please Train the model first by running trainmodel.ipynb file
2. For live prediction, please run realtimedetection.py file and get real-time emotion detection results.

Here are some output screenshots-
