# Face_Emotion_Recognition_Machine_Learning
Hello Everyone !! This is a project using OpenCV library in Machine Learning for Face Emotion Detection .
It also works on live detection and is highly accurate .

To run code-
1. Please Train model first by running trainmodel.ipynb file
2. For live prediction, please run realtimedetection.py file and get a real time emotion detection results.

Here are some ouput screenshots-
